# What Adrian is doing now

_Last updated: June 18th, 2019._

This page is accessible from [here](https://thinkadrian.gitbooks.io/public/content/Now.html), and was inspired by [this post by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).

Here's what I'm doing now:

* Living in Brooklyn, NY, with Kayo, Kai, Alyssa, John, and Gabriel.
* Working at [Genoa Healthcare](https://www.genoatelepsychiatry.com/) as Senior Product Manager.
* Helping Kai with making his life an "Amazing and Excellent Adventure" at [Future Kreative](https://futurekreative.com/).
* Helping Kayo keep [BK Sensei](https://bksensei.com/) up and running.
