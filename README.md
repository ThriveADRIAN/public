# About /public

This is a my attempt to have a public, accountable self. My goal is to discover how I view the world, and express it as concisely and honestly as possible so that others can let me know when I'm full of shit or missing something.

The Book of Beliefs should mostly be fairly self-explanatory from there, but definitely let me know \(by adding a comment here, or DMing me \([on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thriveadrian)\) if you have any questions or comments about anything at all!
